Description :

Lewinsky is her name. Her job is to keep you stress-free! She lets you forget things. Just drop her a mail and she will take note of whatever it is that you need to forget.

Lewinsky is the PA for the lazy. It works on a simple mailing interface. You can use lewinsky to take notes and set up reminders. And what's new with that? For one, lewinsky stacks your notes. You can add on to the same note over time. Still not impressed? Lewinsky can replay your notes to you as reminders. Now you can let your imagination fly. Using the two, you can build up agendas, set alarms, automate OOO mails, etc. 

So get creative, try her out!

Usage :

Mail to note@mylewinsky.com

The body of the mail is the note and the subject of the mail is the subject of the note. The note's subject uniquely identifies the note and you can use the same subject if you want to stack on to the note later.

You can further schedule actions on this note. The actions are mail/call/msg. You can schedule these actions for a particular time; you can add a repeat pattern to the scheduled action (yearly, monthly, weekly, daily, hourly or minutely). And if you get fed up of the scheduled actions, you can cancel them.

Special tokens are as follows :
@action : Action that you want to schedule (mail / call / msg)
@date : Date at which you want to schedule actions in the format YYYY-MM-ddTHH:mm
@repeat : repetition pattern (yearly / monthly / weekly / daily / hourly / minutely)
@to : recipient of the action. email id in case of mail, phone number in case of call / msg
@cancel : cancellation of action
