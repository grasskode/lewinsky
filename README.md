[Lewinsky](http://www.mylewinsky.com/) is her name. And her job is to keep you stress-free! She lets you forget things. Just drop her a mail and she will take note of whatever it is that you need to forget.

Lewinsky is the PA for the lazy. It works on a simple mailing interface. You can use lewinsky to take notes and set up reminders. And what's new with that? For one, lewinsky stacks your notes. You can add on to the same note over time. Still not impressed? Lewinsky can replay your notes to you as reminders. Now you can let your imagination fly. Using the two, you can build up agendas, set alarms, automate sick leave mails, etc.

So get creative; try her out!


## USAGE

To use Lewinsky you simply need to mail your notes to note@mylewinsky.com. The subject of the note will map to the subject of the note and the body of the mail will be the note with the exception of a few special tokens. Simple enough?

You can stack to the same note by mailing Lewinsky again with the same subject line. Any body will be appended to a note with the same subject.

## EXAMPLES

Say its 3 AM and you suddenly realise that you have forgot your girlfriend's birthday. Her phone's switched off. Now you have to buy her an expensive gift tomorrow. You want to be reminded about it at 6 PM when you leave office. Send this mail to note@mylewinsky.com :

Subject : Buy Gift
Body : Buy a shit expensive gift or you will get no cookies! @action mail @date 2020-02-30T18:00

Now lets say you think you might not check the mail since you might be on road and you want to be called to remind you the same. Send another mail to note@mylewinsky.com :

Subject : Buy Gift
Body : @action call @to +91xxxxxxxxxx

Since the subject is the same, you need not specify the body. The body of the last message will be played back to you in the call. At the same time as was specified in the last mail.
